    <h1>Bluesky team activity tracker</h1>
    <p>This is an off-site Bluesky activity tracker for members of the Bluesky team, purely for transparency.</p>
    <p>It does not show deleted posts, unfollows, removed likes, etc. It only shows what is easily accessible from the public Bluesky API</p>
    <p>If you would like to be removed from this, all you have to do is tag or message @literallyjustadog.online on Bluesky :)</p>
